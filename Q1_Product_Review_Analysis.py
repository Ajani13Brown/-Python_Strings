# Task 1: Keyword Highlighter

# Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.

# Task 3: Review Summary
# Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary.
# Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.
